# C++ implementation of euclidean division 

### General info

Euclidean division implementation and comparsion with the C++ truncated definition (since C++11).

> This still leaves a sign ambiguity if the remainder is non-zero: two possible choices for the remainder occur, one negative and the other positive, and two possible choices for the quotient occur.

So, considering the positive remainder, the difference only occurs when $a < 0$. 

For $a â‰¥ 0$ the results are identical.

### How to use

Input absolute values, the resulting table will include all combinations of negative and positive quotients and remainders.
